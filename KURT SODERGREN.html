    <p class="text">Co-founder Kurt Sodergren's 20 plus year career as the drummer for Big Bad Voodoo Daddy was a natural fit â€” his grandfather played in swing and jazz bands most of his life including a stint with the US Army Big Band during WWII. Shortly after meeting Scotty Morris in the late 80's, they formed Big Bad Voodoo Daddy as a trio, soon expanding the lineup and adding jazz elements to their already gritty blues format. More than two decades later Kurt's favorite moments remain playing new venues and the now de rigueur post show meet and greet. "It's a great way to stay connected to our fans and form a sort of patchwork family across the country."</p>
