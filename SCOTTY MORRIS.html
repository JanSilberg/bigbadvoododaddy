    <p class="text">Big Bad Voodoo Daddy singer / songwriter Scotty Morris has spent the last two and a half decades committed to writing and performing original and classic American jazz and swing music. The band, formed by Morris in Ventura, California in 1989, was named "Big Bad Voodoo Daddy" after Scotty met Texas blues guitar legend Albert Collins at one of the latter's concerts. "He signed my poster 'To Scotty, the big bad voodoo daddy.' I thought it was the greatest name I had ever heard on one of the greatest musical nights of my life. So when it came time to name this band, I didn't really have a choice. I felt like it was handed down to me." </p>
