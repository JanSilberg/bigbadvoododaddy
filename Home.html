                From our very first show at a backyard party, until today, nearly 3000 shows later, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy’s unending goal has always been to play good music, and have fun while doing it.

                April 25th, 2018 marks the 25th anniversary of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy’s first show on April 25th, 1993 at that backyard party in Ventura California.
               
               We couldn't have done it without you.
               
               From those partygoers at our first show, 25 years ago, to the folks we continue to play for, all year long,
               
               Thank you!

                Kentucky is known for the Kentucky Derby and Bluegrass music, but did you know that Teacher Mary S. Wilson held the first observance of Mother's Day in Henderson Kentucky in 1887?
                Six years later in 1893 in Louisville Kentucky, two sisters, Patty and Mildred J. Hill, wrote the melody to the song “Happy Birthday to you,” for their Kindergarten class. And of course, no Kentucky list of trivia would be complete, without mentioning that the swimsuit that Mark Spitz wore in the 1972 Olympic games was manufactured in Paris, Kentucky.  How’s that for some mind blowing trivia? 
                All kidding aside, we are looking forward to visiting one of Kentucky’s nicest venues, The Glema Mahr Center for the arts, in Madisonville Kentucky.  You can enjoy great acoustics from any of it’s 950 seats. We plan to bring our special voodoo blend to the Glema Mahr on Thursday, October 4th.  We’ll see you there!

                At first glance, rock 'n roll and golf don't mix. Maybe at second glance, too. But with its venue The Cowan, golf entertainment facility Topgolf Nashville is looking to become a contender in the city's live music scene. The Cowan named "Topgolf Live" until just a few weeks ago is the first dedicated music venue opened by Topgolf. The 600-capacity room, located on the bottom floor of the 65,000-square-foot Topgolf building, opened in late September 2017. Over the last several months, the venue has hosted diverse acts ranging from rock great Los Lobos to Charles Kelley of pop-country trio Lady Antebellum. The pristine room, with gleaming cement floors and a 16-by-9-foot LED wall, was designed by Topgolf architects the Aria Group and J Sound Services,  There isn't a bad sightline in the house, and with one main bar and two satellite bars, the drinks flow fast.  Seems like a great place for a show.  We hope to see y’all there on Friday, October 5th!

                No one can really confirm or deny if Davey Crockett, the King of the wild Frontier, killed a bear when he was only three. Nor do we know for sure if he fought “single handed,” in the “Injun” war. But if, the creditability of the song can be judged by it’s very first line, the songs authenticity is, let’s say, a bit questionable. Because, In fact, Davey Crockett was not “born on a mountain top in Tennessee,” He was born on the banks of Limestone Creek near Greeneville, Tennessee, where a replica of the Crockett's log cabin stands today. 
                As it so happens , the (self professed) “Kings of the wild-swing music- frontier,” are coming to the same storied Greenville, on Saturday, October 6th, when we bring our voodoo to the Niswonger Performing arts center. This $7 million dollar venue in Greenville Tennessee boasts 39,000 square feet and a seating capacity of nearly  1,150 guests. The Niswonger Performing Arts center provides a wide selection of programming including musical artists in multiple genres and touring theatrical performances. NPAC serves as the primary performance venue for local students participating in band and choral programs, and also offers school day educational performances benefitting children throughout the region. It’s a great place, We were there in November of 2013, and we’re very excited to return again. As far as I know, none of us have killed a bear, but we plan to play a killer show, metaphorically of course, on October 6th.

                Did you know that once upon a time, North Carolina—and not California—was known as “the Golden State?” In 1799, a 17-pound nugget unexpectedly turned up in Cabarrus County. This event triggered something that the United States had never seen before: A gold rush. Over the next several decades, miners would try to strike it rich throughout western and central North Carolina. Almost overnight, Charlotte went from a small town to a booming metropolis. Profitable mines (such as the McComb) popped up around town and, in fact, many of their tunnels are still hiding beneath Charlotte’s outskirts. 
                You probably already know that Charlotte’s current NBA team is called “The Hornets.” You might also notice that there’s a hornet nest logo emblazoned on the sides of Charlotte-Mecklenburg police vehicles. Do you know Why this community so infatuated with stinging insects? In 1780, British General Charles Cornwallis marched his men through the city, where they encountered firm resistance. He’d go on to call Charlotte “a hornet’s nest of rebellion.” Little did he realize that the town would wholeheartedly embrace his comment. Today, Charlotte’s two main nicknames are “the Queen City” and “the Hornet’s Nest.” 
                Did you know that The Dairy Queen on Wilkinson Boulevard, in Charlotte, a designated historic site, displays the only Dairy Queen Eskimo still in use in the country? That tid-bit is almost as cool as Mark Spitz’s swim suit ! Almost… 
                Lastly, did you know that the Neighborhood Theater in “NoDa” Charlotte’s historic arts district, filled with restaurants, shops and bars, was originally built as a movie theater in 1945, called the Astor Theatre? It was closed in the late 70s. The Neighborhood Theatre underwent restoration in 1997 and was converted into a live performance venue. A performance venue that will host Big Bad Voodoo Daddy on Sunday, October 4th. Did you know that Big Bad Voodoo Daddy has played close to 3000 shows and has been a band for over 25 years? Ok, just checking. Come join us on Sunday and we can talk over some more trivia!
